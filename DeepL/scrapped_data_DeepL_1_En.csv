John Collin,1,2024-05-31 05:41:23,"Ensikokemus suomesta englanniksi valokuvasta kääntäen on tosi kehno. Ohjelma tuottaa täysin puuta-heinää laittaen sinänsä oikei käännettyjä pätkiä aivan väärään järjestykseen. Toisena puutteena tässä on se, että antaa sanalle vain yhden vaihtoehdon. Pitäisi antaa usea vaihtoehto ja kuvailu, missä kontekstissa kukin vaihtoehto toimii, kuten vanhoissa hyvissä paperikirjoissa."

Juan Boy,1,2024-05-29 06:46:10,"At least with English <-> Spanish written translations much of what is translated is completely wrong, sometimes even the opposite meaning and words missed out completely, with no way of correcting it or giving feedback within the app. Careful. Do not rely on it."

The pronunciations are much more accurate compared to a certain other widespread translator. The translations as well; I love that it gives the option to choose the format of each sentence, clarifying each word. It has helped me make sense of different slangs & more complicated sentences. (ie. languages with optional first person nouns, different grammar etc)"

Perry Phillips,5,2024-05-22 06:59:20,"Fantastic lexicon for looking up words with whatever declension or grammatical form appears. In other words, one does not have to know the ""pure form"" of a word to look up its meaning. Highly recommended for translating on the fly."

Andre,2,2024-05-19 18:07:09,revising my 5 stars review. the translation got worse. I don't know what happened but sometimes it's just ridiculous. it stopped recognizing the meaning of context of text to translate and is now worse sometimes than Google translator 5 years ago. Meantime it's AI era lol.
Vassil Dimitrov,5,2024-05-19 17:23:54,It's better than Google Translate. You can customize translations to desired gender and change between formal/casual. You can also change words in translation with proposed synonyms.
Clara Bartha,5,2024-05-19 12:41:37,"Accurate,fast, dependable."

Kay Turner,1,2024-05-15 14:30:31,"Absolute rubbish! I tried three different phrases verbally in Japanese to translate to English. It got them ALL. WRONG. For example; ""Kore wa kimini"" does NOT mean ""Call to chimini""! All this app appears to be doing, is 'hearing' a word/phrase and then trying to fit similar sounding words in, from the language you want it translated to - whether they make sense or not."

Maria Rose,5,2024-05-13 21:49:01,"honestly the most accurate app I've found, I'm a French immersion student and when I can't remember a word, or how to explain something, it translates it in an extremely fluent way unlike other apps that translate word for word, and the photo option is great when I can't completely comprehend a text on my own. 100% would recommend as a go to translator"
OBEDI NDUHUKIRE,5,2024-05-13 20:35:48,Good and accurate
